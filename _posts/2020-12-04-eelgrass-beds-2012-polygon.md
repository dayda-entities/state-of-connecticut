Eelgrass Beds 2012 Polygon :
This data layer was created by the Conservation Management Institute, Virginia Tech University for the USFWS National Wetlands Inventory, Region 5. The project area encompasses the eastern end of Long Island Sound, including Fishers Island and the North Fork of Long Island. It includes all coastal embayments and nearshore waters (i.e., to a depth of -15 feet at mean low water) bordering the Sound from Clinton Harbor in the west to the Rhode Island border in the east and including Fishers Island and the North Shore of Long Island from Southold to Orient Point and Plum Island. The study area includes the tidal zone of 18 sub-basins in Connecticut: Little Narragansett Bay, Stonington Harbor, Quiambog Cove, Mystic Harbor, Palmer-West Cove, Mumford Cove, Paquonock River, New London Harbor, Goshen Cove, Jordan Cove, Niantic Bay, Rocky Neck State Park, Old Lyme Shores, Connecticut River, Willard Bay, Westbrook Harbor, Duck Island Roads, and Clinton Harbor, and two areas in New York: Fishers Island and a portion of the North Shore of Long Island. Delineations of 2012 eelgrass beds were completed using 1:20,000 true color aerial photography flown at low tide on August 02, 2012. Earlier photo acquisition was not possible due to unfavorable weather conditions. Field work was conducted by the USFWS Region 5 Southern New England-New York Bight Coastal Program Office on October 02, 2012, prior to Hurricane Sandy. Only one day of field work was conducted due largely to the late season acquisition of imagery and unfavorable weather conditions. Data have been summarized in a technical report: Tiner, R., K. McGuckin, and A. MacLachlan. 2013. 2012 Eelgrass Survey for EasternLong Island Sound, Connecticut and New York.
