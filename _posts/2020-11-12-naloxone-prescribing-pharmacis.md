NEW DATA AVAILABLE HERE: https://data.ct.gov/d/2vby-9bet?category=Public-Safety&view_name=Pharmacies-offering-Narcan-Evzio-and-other-brands-Opens in new window. A listing of Pharmacies and Pharmacists known to prescribe Naloxone. This list will be updated periodically as more pharmacies or pharmacists are identified.
