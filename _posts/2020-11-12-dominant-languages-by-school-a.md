Under Connecticut General Statute 10-17f and NCLB, Local Education Agencies must ascertain the dominant language of all new K-12 students, which is typically done through a home language survey. This dataset contains the dominant languages reported by LEAs for students and English Learners during the 2014-15 school year by school.
