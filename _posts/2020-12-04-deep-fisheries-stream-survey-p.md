Fisheries Stream Survey Site includes points along streams which have been surveyed for a variety of characteristics relative to fish habitat. This datalayer includes stream location information; chemical data such as dissolved oxygen, pH, alkalinity and conductivity, and air and water temperature; and physical data such as width and depth of the stream, water velocity, discharge volume, substrate summary information, and instream cover materials. Site report details are provided, which described the number of pools along the stream, flow stability, dominant rock type, and whether the stream is located below a dam or lake. Finally, fish population information about the stream is assessed, including type of species and estimated numbers per hectare. Invertebrate data are also included, such as the existence of crayfish or clams/mussels.
Only the major rivers and trout management areas are updated annually. The remaining streams are not updated.
