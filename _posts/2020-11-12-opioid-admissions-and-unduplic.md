This dataset displays the number of unduplicated clients and the number of admissions to opioid treatment at DHMAS-funded and private treatment facilities by town and per state fiscal year (July 1 through June 30).

For the count of unduplicated clients, each person is only counted once per town and per state fiscal year. For example, if someone living in Hartford entered treatment twice during state fiscal year 2017, that person would only be counted once. The total count of unduplicated clients (after being deduplicated between towns) is:

2014: 13,520	
2015: 14,947	
2016: 14,956	
2017: 14,769	
2018: 14,433	
% change/5 yrs: 7%

For the count of admissions, a person may be counted more than once per town and per state fiscal year. For example, if someone living in Hartford entered treatment twice during state fiscal year 2017, that would be reflected in two admissions towards the total.
