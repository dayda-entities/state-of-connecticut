A revaluation program is undertaken to secure a more equitable distribution of the tax burden, to bring the assessment level up to date, and to modernize assessment procedures. Furthermore, Connecticut law requires that all property be revalued for assessment purposes periodically. A revaluation is required to be completed every five years. The purpose of this requirement is to insure uniformity in real property valuations by eliminating inequities that may have developed since the previous revaluation. Updated September 2013
