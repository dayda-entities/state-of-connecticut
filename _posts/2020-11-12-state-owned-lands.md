March 2018 - Payment in Lieu of Taxes (PILOT)

A listing of individual properties owned by the State of Connecticut, which is collected and updated annually in March by the Office of Policy and Management. This inventory is maintained primarily for the purposes of payments in lieu of property taxes (PILOT) to the host municipality. The column "Reference Number" refers to the unique ID for the parcel (if available) and the "Address" column contains the physical address when assigned by the municipality, otherwise the street name is provided.
