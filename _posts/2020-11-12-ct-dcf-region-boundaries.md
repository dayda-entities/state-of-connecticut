This is a boundary file showing the catchment area for which each of the 6 DCFRegions is responsible. Catchment areas are comprised of complete Towns, but not necessarily complete Zip Codes. Data is as of 7/1/2014, is unlikely to change frequently, and will be updated only as changes are made to the catchment areas.
