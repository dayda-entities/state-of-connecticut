This file contains a row for the unique combination of in-care date (first of each state fiscal year), DCF Region/Office responsible for the child's case, Age Group and whether the placement is inside or outside of CT. This file will be updated on an annual basis, on or about October 1st of each year. Rollups that Sum across Month-In-Care dates are NOT valid; though Averages, Medians, Minimum or Maximum values can be calculated with meaningful results. See attached metadata document for more detail and column definitions.
