This dataset contains data for 2014-2019 sourced from the State of Connecticut Uniform Chart of Accounts (UCOA). This system enables the annual collection of unaudited municipal trial balance data at the local account level, along with a mapping, or “cross walk” of that data to a standard, uniform chart of accounts for comparative purposes. This data is collected and stored in a system of databases developed for the Office of Policy and Management (OPM), including a Data Warehouse of financial balances. These balances are recorded at the account level and contain both local and uniform account metadata.
