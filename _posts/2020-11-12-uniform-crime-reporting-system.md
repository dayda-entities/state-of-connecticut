The Uniform Crime Reporting Program measures the extent, fluctuation and distribution of crime throughout the United States. After counting Crime Index offenses reported, minus any unfounded complaints, contributors provide the number of “actual offenses” and the number of crimes cleared. For a criminal offense to be “cleared,” either of the following situations must prevail: (1) at least one person is arrested, charged, and turned over to the court for prosecution; or (2) some element beyond police control precludes the physical arrest of the offender (e.g., death of offender, victim refuses to cooperate, confession by offender already in police custody), resulting in the offense being cleared by “exceptional means.” Contributing agencies also include data on the value of property stolen and recovered in connection with the reported offenses, plus specific information regarding homicides, officers assaulted and arson.
