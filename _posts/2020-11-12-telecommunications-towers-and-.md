Connecticut General Statutes ยง16-50dd requires the Connecticut Siting Council to develop, maintain and update on a quarterly basis a Statewide Telecommunications Coverage Database that includes the location, type and height of all telecommunications towers and antennas in the state. Although the Siting Council has made every effort to ensure that this database is as inclusive as possible, it makes no representation that all telecommunications sites in the state are included in this listing. As the Siting Council becomes aware of sites that are unlisted, it takes steps to add these sites to the listing. The Council also welcomes corrections or additions to this database
