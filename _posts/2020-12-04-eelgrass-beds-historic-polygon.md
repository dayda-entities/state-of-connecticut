Eelgrass Beds Historic Set:



Historic Eelgrass Points is a 1:24,000-scale, point feature-based layer that depicts the locations of historic eelgrass beds (Zostera marina) in Long Island Sound, the Connecticut River, the Quinnipiac River and other bays, harbors and waterbodies in Connecticut's coastal area. It also includes several points located along the north shore of Long Island. There are a total of 131 point features, the majority of which are located east of the Connecticut River. Point features in this layer are compiled from two major sources: 1) the polygon feature label points in the Historic Eelgrass Beds polygon layer representing sources with a mapping component; and 2) additional points that were based on historic literature review that had no mapping component. Source information including source description and collection date for each point is described in the layer's table data. Feature locations are inexact. Because of the variety of source maps and methods used for their automation, this coverage should be considered to have limited spatial accuracy and is appropriate for general uses only. Actual data collection ranged from 1873 through 1996. This layer was published in 1997 and is not updated. It does not represent current conditions.

Historic Eelgrass Bed Polygons is a 1:24,000-scale, polygon feature-based layer that depicts the locations of historic eelgrass beds (Zostera marina) in Long Island Sound and the Niantic River, as well as in other bays, harbors and waterbodies in Connecticut's coastal area. It also includes several points located along the north shore of Long Island. There are a total of 52 polygon features, all of which (except the Long Island points), are located within or east of the Niantic River. This layer can be used with Historic Eelgrass Points. This layer does not represent current conditions. Rather, it depicts historic eelgrass bed locations that were observed and defined either cartographically or narratively over the course of many years and from various sources. The dates of each source's data collection are noted in the attribute table. Feature locations are inexact. Because of the variety of source maps and methods used for their automation, this information should be considered to have limited spatial accuracy and is appropriate for general uses only. The data was taken from maps of various scales and projections that were drawn between 1905 and 1996. These maps were reduced to approximately 1:24,000 scale and adjusted for best fit; eelgrass areas were redrafted onto USGS Topographic Quadrangle maps for digitizing. In order to create a single polygon coverage, areas were considered to represent a maximum extent of eelgrass beds. This layer was published in 1997 and is not updated.
