This is a boundary file showing the catchment area for which each of the 14 DCF Area Offices is responsible.  Catchment areas are comprised of complete Towns, but not necessarily complete Zip Codes.  Data is as of 7/1/2014, is unlikely to change frequently, and will be updated only as changes are made to the catchment areas.
