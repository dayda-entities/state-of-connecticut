As of 11/25/2020, this dataset is no longer being updated. More data in school learning model can be accessed here: https://data.ct.gov/Education/Learning-Model-Enrollment-and-Percent-Remote-by-Sc/5q7h-u2ac

This dataset includes the percentage of public school students PK-12 who are fully remote by town during a given week of the school year. 

The percent of students remote for a town is determined based on all districts and Approved Private Special Education Programs (APSEPs) located in that town. CT Technical Education and Career Districts (CTECS) and Regional Education Service Center School Districts (RESCs) are excluded from this calculation because they have schools in several towns. For towns that are part of a regional school district for all grades or some grades, the percent remote for each member town will reflect the same value based on the total of all districts and APSEPs in those member towns.

In some cases, multiple towns have been grouped together to calculate the number and percent of students who are fully remote; the towns included in the calculation are noted in the column called "Remote calculation town group."

When an asterisk is displayed, data have been suppressed to safeguard student confidentiality, or to ensure that statistics based on a very small sample size are not interpreted as equally representative as those based on a sufficiently larger sample size.
