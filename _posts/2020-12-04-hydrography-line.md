Connecticut Hydrography Set:

Connecticut Hydrography Line includes the line features of a layer named Hydrography. Hydrography is a 1:24,000-scale, polygon and line feature-based layer that includes all hydrography features depicted on the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle maps for the State of Connecticut. This layer only includes features located in Connecticut. These hydrography features include waterbodies, inundation areas, marshes, dams, aqueducts, canals, ditches, shorelines, tidal flats, shoals, rocks, channels, and islands. Hydrography is comprised of polygon and line features. Polygon features represent areas of water for rivers, streams, brooks, reservoirs, lakes, ponds, bays, coves, and harbors. Polygon features also depict inundation areas, marshes, dams, aqueducts, canals, tidal flats, shoals, rocks, channels, and islands shown on the USGS 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle maps. Line features represent single-line rivers and streams, aqueducts, canals, and ditches. Line features also enclose all polygon features in the form of natural shorelines, manmade shorelines, dams, closure lines separating adjacent waterbodies, and the apparent limits for tidal flats, rocks, and areas of marsh. The layer is based on information from USGS topographic quadrangle maps published between 1969 and 1984 so it does not depict conditions at any one particular point in time. Also, the layer does not reflect recent changes with the course of streams or location of shorelines impacted by natural events or changes in development since the time the USGS 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle maps were published. Attribute information is comprised of codes to identify hydrography features by type, cartographically represent (symbolize) hydrography features on a map, select waterbodies appropriate to display at different map scales, identify individual waterbodies on a map by name, and describe feature area and length. The names assigned to individual waterbodies are based on information published on the USGS 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle maps or other state and local maps. The layer does not include bathymetric, stream gradient, water flow, water quality, or biological habitat information. This layer was originally published in 1994. The 2005 edition includes the same water features published in 1994, however some attribute information has been slightly modified and made easier to use. Also, the 2005 edition corrects previously undetected attribute coding errors.
