Note: *: Beginning in 2005, only town level permit data will be reported as the Bureau of Census changed its sampling method and only 128 municipalities will have monthly permit data. Towns with "na" represent annual reporters. 
Note: **: Revised 2004 data with towns reporting on a monthly basis. The remaining towns are coded as "na" for month-over-month comparison.
