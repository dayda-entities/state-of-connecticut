In 1995 it was recognized that current Connecticut tidal wetland boundary information was critical to ensure the appropriate management and protection of the tidal wetlands resource. At this time the 1970's maps had become increasingly dated, with the growth of new tidal wetland areas and the restoration of others. The maps were contributing to the confusion over state versus municipal wetland jurisdiction. It was in this climate that the current project was conceived. The aim of this mapping effort was to provide current, geometrically correct tidal wetland map products that would serve as a guide to the jurisdictional boundaries for federal, state and municipal regulators and private land holders.
'Tidal Wetlands' are defined as follows: 'Tidal Wetlands' means 'wetland' as defined by C.G.S.Sec. 22a-29. C.G.S.Sec.22a-93(7)(E). 'Wetland' means those areas which border or lie beneath tidal waters, such as, but not limited to banks, bogs, salt marshes, swamps, meadows, flats, or other low lands subject to tidal action, including those areas now or formerly connected to tidal waters, and whose surface is at or below an elevation of one foot above local extreme high water; and upon which may grow or be capable of growing some but not necessarily all, of the following: (See the statute for a complete listing of tidally influenced plant species) C.G.S.Sec.22a-29(2).
Thus, the actual tidal wetland boundary is determined by the application of these criteria, including identifying the presence or absence of tidally influenced plants. While the field determination of these criteria results in the most accurate tidal wetland boundary delineation, the identification of different plant types and low lying areas can also be achieved, at a high level of accuracy, through the use of large scale, stereo aerial photography. This latter method was determined as being the most efficient method to delineate vegetated tidal wetlands across the entire state of Connecticut. It should be noted that similarly to the previous tidal wetlands mapping efforts, no attempt was made to delineate those areas that were formerly connected to tidal flow, as these areas are difficult to identify by either field or photo interpretation techniques.
The area mapped in the Tidal Wetlands 1990's datalayer includes all tidal, coastal and navigable waters and tidal wetlands of Connecticut with the exception of the Lower Connecticut River, which was mapped as part of the 1994 Ramsar Convention program. Between both programs, a total of 15,178 acres of tidal wetlands were mapped.
