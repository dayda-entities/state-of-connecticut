<div><a href='https://cteco.uconn.edu/guides/Soils_Inland_Wetland.htm' rel='nofollow ugc' target='_blank'>See full Data Guide here.</a><br /></div>The Connecticut Inland Wetlands and Watercourses Act, Connecticut General Statutes Section 22a-38, defines wetland soils to include, &quot;Any of the soil types designated as poorly drained, very poorly drained, alluvial, and floodplain by the National Cooperative Soil Survey, as may be amended from time to time, of the Natural Resources Conservation Service of the United States Department of Agriculture&quot;. For additional documentation including a description of the map legend for Inland Wetland Soils, refer to the CT ECO Complete Resource Guide for Inland Wetland Soils.

All soil information included in the CT ECO maps and map viewers is from the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) Web Soil Survey (WSS), which is based on information originally published on the set of Soil Survey quarter quadrangle maps that cover Connecticut.
