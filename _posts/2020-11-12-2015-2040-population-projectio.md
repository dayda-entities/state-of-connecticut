The 2015 to 2040 population projections for towns in the state of Connecticut were developed by the Connecticut State Data Center for planning, analysis, and to inform decision making. The projections are individual population projections for the resident population of each of Connecticut's 169 towns and were published on August 31, 2017. These projections supersede the 2012 edition of the population projections developed by the Connecticut State Data Center.
