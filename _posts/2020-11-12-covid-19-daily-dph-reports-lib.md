A library of daily reports produced by the Department of Public Health on COVID-19 data in Connecticut, starting on March 21, 2020. Reports are published daily to https://portal.ct.gov/Coronavirus/COVID-19-Data-Tracker

Additional notes:
Starting on November 20, 2020, the DPH daily report will be accessible as a webpage rather than a PDF report at the following link: https://data.ct.gov/stories/s/q5as-kyim . A more detailed report will be released as a PDF on Thursdays, and the link to those reports will be added to this dataset weekly.

Starting in July 2020, this dataset will be updated every weekday.
