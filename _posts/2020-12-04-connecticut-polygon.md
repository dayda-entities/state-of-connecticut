Connecticut State Line includes the line features of a layer named Connecticut. Connecticut is a 1:24,000-scale, polygon and line feature-based layer that depicts the geographic area encompassed by and the boundary for the State of Connecticut. The State of Connecticut is represented as one polygon feature surrounded by linear boundary features. The layer is based on information from USGS topographic quadrangle maps published between 1969 and 1984 and latitude and longitude coordinates that define the boundary between the states of Connecticut and New York in Long Island Sound. Feature length and geographic area are encoded for linear and polygon features, respectively. This layer was originally published in 1994.
