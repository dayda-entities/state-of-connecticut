-	 Reporting units of sample results [where 1 picoCurie (pCi) = 1 trillionth (1E-12) Curie (Ci)]:
•	Air Samples are reported in pCi/m&#179;.

-	Data Quality Disclaimer:
This database is for informational use and is not a controlled quality database.  Efforts have been made to ensure accuracy of data in the database; however, errors and omissions may occur. 

Examples of potential errors include:
•	Data entry errors.
•	Lab results not reported for entry into the database.
•	Missing results due to equipment failure or unable to retrieve samples due to lost or environmental hazards.
•	Translation errors – the data has been migrated to newer data platforms numerous times, and each time there have been errors and data losses.

-  Error results are the calculated uncertainty for the sample measurement results and are reported as +/-.

-	Environmental Sample Records are from the year 1998 until present.  Prior to 1998 results were stored in hardcopy, in a non-database format.

Requests for results from samples taken prior to 1998 or results subject to quality assurance are available from archived records and can be made through the DEEP Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) administrator at deep.foia@ct.gov. Information on 
FOIA requests can be found on the DEEP website.
