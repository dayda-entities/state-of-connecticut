Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program caseloads and expenditures
Footnote: September 2011 - November 2011 issuances were high due to Tropical Storm Irene.   Additional funding was provided to Connecticut as both an increase in benefits to SNAP recipients as well as to provide D-SNAP benefits to Non-SNAP recipients that were affected.
