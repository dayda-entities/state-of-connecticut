<div><a href='https://cteco.uconn.edu/guides/Natural_Diversity_Database.htm' rel='nofollow ugc' target='_blank'>See full Data Guide here</a>.<br /></div>The Natural Diversity Database Areas is a 1:24,000-scale, polygon feature-based layer that represents general locations of endangered, threatened and special concern species and significant natural communities. The layer is based on information collected by DEEP staff, cooperating scientists, conservation groups and landowners. In some cases an occurrence represents a location derived from literature, museum records and specimens. These data are compiled and maintained by the DEEP Bureau of Natural Resources, Natural Diversity Database Program. The layer is updated every six months and reflects information that has been submitted and accepted up to that point. The layer includes state and federally listed species and significant natural communities. It does not include Natural Area Preserves, designated wetland areas or wildlife concentration areas. These general locations were created by randomly shifting the true locations of terrestrial species and then adding a 0.25 mile buffer distance to each point, and by mapping linear segments with a 300 foot buffer associated with aquatic, riparian and coastal species. The exact location of the species or community falls somewhere within the polygon area and not necessarily in the center. Attribute information includes the date when these data were last updated. Species names are withheld to protect sensitive species from collection and disturbance. Data is compiled at 1:24,000 scale. These data are updated every six months, approximately in June and December. It is important to use the most current data available.<div><br /></div><div><br /></div>
