A listing of Census Tracts including the names of towns in which they fall for CT. In 2010, the Census tract data no longer contained information necessary to associate tracts with towns (Minor Civil Division in Census terms). This file was generated to allow data users in CT to summarize census data to the town level in Connecticut
