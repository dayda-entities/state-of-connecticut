Priority Funding Areas are delineated based on conditions that exist at the Census Block level, which is the smallest geographical unit delineated by the U.S. Census Bureau. Census Blocks are statistical areas which in Connecticut are typically bounded by visible features, such as streets, roads, streams, and railroad lines. Generally, Census Blocks in denser urban communities are small in area, such as a block in a city that is bounded on all sides by streets. However, Census Blocks in suburban and rural areas may be large, or irregular, and bounded by a variety of features, such as roads or streams. For example, a specific Census Block may be partially served by public water and/or sewer, and thus the entire block would appear to be served by these utilities. There were several instances during the public comment period where municipalities requested that certain Census Blocks be removed from this classification, and such requests were granted. Any limitations in the use of Census Blocks in this LGM should not be construed as influencing local land use and zoning decisions or municipal plans of conservation and development; nor should it create any expectation for future utility service where none currently exists.
Priority Funding Areas are classified by Census Blocks that include:  Designation as an Urban Area or Urban Cluster in the 2010 Census Boundaries that intersect a ½ mile buffer surrounding existing or planned mass-transit stations Existing or planned sewer service from an adopted Wastewater Facility Plan Existing or planned water service from an adopted Public Drinking Water Supply Plan Local bus service provided 7 days a week
