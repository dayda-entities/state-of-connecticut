This dataset contains aggregate data concerning the number of children who entered DCF placement during a given SFY (July 1 â€“ June 30).  These figures are broken out by the DCF Region and Office responsible for the child's care, the child's Race/Ethnicity, and the Placement Type category into which the child was initially placed.
