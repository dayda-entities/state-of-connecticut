The Census Planning Database is produced by the U.S. Census Bureau. It assembles a range of housing, demographic, socioeconomic, and census operational data that can be used for survey and census planning. 

The Planning Database uses selected Census and selected 2012-2016 American Community Survey (ACS) estimates. In addition to variables extracted from the census and ACS databases, operational variables include the 2010 Census Mail Return Rate for each block group and tract.

This dataset is a subset of the 2018 Census Planning Database, filtered for the state of Connecticut, and including variables relating to geography. Variables relating to population, households, housing units, census operations, and hard to count populations at the tract and block level can also be found on the CT Data Portal with the tag "Census 2020."
