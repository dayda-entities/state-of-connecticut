AVERAGE MONTHLY ASSISTANCE UNITS AND RECIPIENTS BY TOWN, 
STATE FISCAL YEAR 2009 
* Due to rounding some towns may not display a case but will display recipients.  This is due to most cases having more than one recipient and therefore when averaged,the recipient count will be .5 or higher, and be counted as 1. Note: Due to rounding, program and statewide totals may appear inaccurate.
