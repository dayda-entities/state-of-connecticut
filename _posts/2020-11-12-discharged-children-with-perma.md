This dataset contains aggregate data concerning the number of child placement episodes that ended with a legal discharge from DCF care, and for whom the end of a 12 month observation period (starting with their legal discharge date) terminated during the SFY.  These figures are broken out by the DCF Region and Office responsible for the child's care, by their Race/Ethnicity, and by whether another placement episode for that child began within 12 months of their discharge from care or not.  It would be appropriate to roll up the data from all variables across multiple time periods, as they represent specific events in the lives of these children.  These data form the basis of measurement for the Juan F. Consent Decree Exit Plan Outcome #11: Permanency Maintained (No Re-Entry), although those figures are reported to the DCF Court Monitor on a quarterly rather than annual schedule.
