<div><a href='https://cteco.uconn.edu/guides/DEP_Property.htm' rel='nofollow ugc' target='_blank'>See full Data Guide here.Â </a><br /></div>DEEP Property is a polygon feature-based layer that includes all land owned in fee simple interest by the State of Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection. This layer is based on information that was collected and mapped at various scales and at different levels of accuracy. Generally, partial interests such as easements or development rights are not included in this layer. The exception is flood control areas, which may include permanent easements. Types of property in this layer include parks, forests, wildlife areas, flood control areas, scenic preserves, natural areas, historic reserves, DEEP owned waterbodies, water access sites and other miscellaneous properties. This layer is current and is updated as parcels are acquired by DEEP.
