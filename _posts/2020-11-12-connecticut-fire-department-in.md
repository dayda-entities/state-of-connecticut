This dataset contains Connecticut Fire Department Incidents as reported to the National Fire Department Incident Reporting System (NFIRS).

Note that the 2014 and 2016 data has far more entries than the other years.  In particular, they detail "False Alarm and False Calls" and "Rescue and Emergency Medical Service (EMS) Incidents"

NFIRS collects details on Fire, HazMat and EMS incidences nationwide, detailing the type of incident, where it occurred, the resources used to mitigate it and more, with a goal of understanding the nature and causes of the incidents. Information is also collected on the number of civilian or firefighter casualties and an estimate of property loss.

Participation in NFIRS is voluntary.  

Data is released yearly, with a considerable delay.

Each Incidence is assigned a 3 digit Incidence Type Code.  The code describes the situation emergency personnel found when they arrived.  Incidence Types are grouped into larger categories, called Series.  

For example, Series 400, 'Hazardous Condition' category includes incidence types: 411, 'Gasoline or other flammable liquid spill; 412, 'Gas leak and 413, 'Oil or other combustible liquid spill '.

Not every Incidence Type is included in the data.   In 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015, the NFIRS data releases contained these Series/Incidence Types:

  Series 100: Fire Incidences,
  Series 400: Hazardous Condition (No Fire),
  Incidence Type 561: Unauthorized burning, under the 'Service Call' Series,
  Incidence Type 631: Authorized Controlled Burning, under the 'Good Intent Call' series and
  Incidence Type 632: Prescribed fires also under the 'Good Intent Call' series.

The 2014 and 2016 release included these additional series:

  200: Overpressure Rupture, Explosion, Overheat (No Fire), 
  300: Rescue and Emergency Medical Service (EMS) Incidents, 
  500: Service Calls, 
  600: Good Intent Call Series,
  700: False Alarm and False Call,
  800 Severe Weather and Natural Disaster
  900: Special Incident Type.

The official NFIRS documentation has been attached to this dataset.
