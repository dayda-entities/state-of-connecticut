This dataset contains aggregate data concerning abuse/neglect reports accepted for a response from DCF.  Traditionally, DCF has had only one manner of responding to such reports, which was a mandated Child Protective Services (CPS) Investigation.  As of April 2012, DCF began responding to low-risk reports through a voluntary Family Assessment Response (FAR) process.  Reports handled through a FAR response still contain allegations that meet the statutory definitions of neglect, but they do not receive a decision concerning whether they are substantiated or not.  This policy has resulted in fewer substantiated allegations since its implementation, but the agency continues to serve as many or more families reported for abuse/neglect.
