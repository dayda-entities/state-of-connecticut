This dataset includes the attendance rate for public school students PK-12 by town during the 2020-2021 school year. 

Attendance rates are provided for each town for the overall student population and for the high needs student population. Students who are considered high needs include students who are English language learners, who receive special education, or who qualify for free and reduced lunch.

When no attendance data is displayed in a cell, data have been suppressed to safeguard student confidentiality, or to ensure that statistics based on a very small sample size are not interpreted as equally representative as those based on a sufficiently larger sample size. For more information on CSDE data suppression policies, please visit http://edsight.ct.gov/relatedreports/BDCRE%20Data%20Suppression%20Rules.pdf.
