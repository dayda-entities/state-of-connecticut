A dataset used to track State Agency implementation of the Public Act 18-175. This also includes a list of Agency Data Officers.

Public Act 18-175 requires each executive branch agency to begin to manage data as an asset. In addition, it bolsters CT's efforts associated with open data. Agencies are required to: 1) designate an Agency Data Officer (ADO), 2) inventory high value data, and 3) create open data access plans.

Agencies continue to work with OPM to meet these goals, and we will update this dataset regularly to reflect their progress until further notice.
