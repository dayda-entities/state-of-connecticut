This dataset contains data on the use of physical restraint and seclusion in Connecticut for the 2012-13 school year. The total number of restraint and seclusion incidents as well as an unduplicated count of students restrained and/or secluded is provided for each district/organization. Data for districts/organizations reporting incidents for fewer than 6 students have been suppressed. For districts/organizations reporting incidents for 6 or more students, disaggregation by the available subgroups is provided. *Please note that if a student had an incident in more than one district/organization, he/she is only counted once in the statewide student count and statewide subgroup counts. The full text of the Annual Report on the Use of Physical Restraint and Seclusion in Connecticut can be found at: http://www.sde.ct.gov/sde/lib/sde/pdf/deps/special/restraint_and_seclusion_annual_report_2012_13.pdf
