Connecticut Mainland Line includes the line features of a layer named Connecticut Mainland. Connecticut Mainland is a 1:24,000-scale, polygon and line feature-based layer that depicts the geographic area encompassed by and the boundary for the State of Connecticut with an additional linear shoreline feature separating the Connecticut mainland from the waters of Long Island Sound. The layer includes a polygon feature representing the Connecticut mainland, a polygon feature representing Connecticut waters in Long Island Sound and approximately 700 polygon features representing Connecticut islands in Long Island Sound. The layer is based on information from USGS topographic quadrangle maps published between 1969 and 1984 and latitude and longitude coordinates that define the boundary between the states of Connecticut and New York in Long Island Sound. Feature length and geographic area are encoded for linear and polygon features, respectively. This layer was originally published in 2005.
