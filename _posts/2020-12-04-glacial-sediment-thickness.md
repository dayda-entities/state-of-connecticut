Thickness of Glacial Sediment in Connecticut and Long Island Sound Set:
The Thickness of Glacial Sediments in Connecticut and the Long Island Sound Basin layer contains interpretive polygon data representing the thickness of glacial sediments in Connecticut and the Long Island Sound Basin. Compiled as part of the Quaternary Geologic Map of Connecticut and Long Island Sound Basin, Stone and others (1998, 2005). Includes thickness of glacial sediments in 50 foot (0-50, 50-100) and then 100 foot (100-200, 200-300, etc) intervals.
Data derived from original mapping at 1:80,000 scale for the Long Island Sound basin and at 1:125,000 scale on the land in Connecticut. The data are NOT recommended for use at higher resolution scales. The purpose is to show the thickness of glacial sediments on land in Connecticut and in the Long Island Sound Basin. This layer can be used other geologic information shown on the Quaternary Geologic Map of Connecticut and Long Island Sound Basin (USGS publication SIM-2784) as well as other geologic GIS data layers for Long Island Sound derived from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) / Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) Marine Geology Cooperative Program. Complimentary data layers include the marine transgressive surface (marinet) and thickness of postglacial deposits (pgthkpol) found on Georeferenced Sea-floor Mapping and Bottom Photography in Long Island Sound (USGS Openfile report 00-304).
