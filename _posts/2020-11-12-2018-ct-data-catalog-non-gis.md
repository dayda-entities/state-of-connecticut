Catalog of high value data inventories produced by Connecticut executive branch agencies and compiled by the Office of Policy and Management. This catalog does not contain information about high value GIS data, which is compiled in a separate data inventory at the following link: https://data.ct.gov/Government/CT-Data-Catalog-GIS-/p7we-na27

As required by Public Act 18-175, executive branch agencies must annually conduct a high value data inventory to capture information about the high value data that they collect. 

High value data is defined as any data that the department head determines (A) is critical to the operation of an executive branch agency; (B) can increase executive branch agency accountability and responsiveness; (C) can improve public knowledge of the executive branch agency and its operations; (D) can further the core mission of the executive branch agency; (E) can create economic opportunity; (F) is frequently requested by the public; (G) responds to a need and demand as identified by the agency through public consultation; or (H) is used to satisfy any legislative or other reporting requirements.

This dataset was last updated 3/4/2019 and will continue to be updated as high value data inventories are submitted to OPM.
