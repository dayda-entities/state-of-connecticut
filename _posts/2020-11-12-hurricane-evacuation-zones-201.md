Evacuation Zones based on 2012 SLOSH zones. The Evacuation Zones were created from the intersection of the 2010 census blocks and the SLOSH zones. They were then trimmed by USACE using input from the coastal towns. Final edits were done by USACE in May, 2014.

Note: Zone value of A or B indicates which Evacuation zone the block is in.
