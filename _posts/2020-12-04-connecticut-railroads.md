Connecticut Railroads is a 1:24,000-scale, feature-based layer that includes railroad features on the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle maps for the State of Connecticut. This layer only includes features located in Connecticut. The layer is based on information from USGS topographic quadrangle maps published between 1969 and 1984 and does not represent the railroad system in Connecticut at any one particular point in time. The layer does not depict current conditions and excludes many railroads that have been built, modified, or removed since the time these topographic quadrangle maps were published. The layer includes railroad tracks, bridges, drawbridges, roundhouses, sidings, tracks, tunnels, underpasses, and stations. It does not include train schedule or track related information. Features are linear and represent railroad track centerlines. Attribute information is comprised of codes to cartographically represent (symbolize) rail features on a map. This layer was originally published in 1994. The 2005 edition includes the same rail features published in 1994, but the attribute information has been slightly modified and made easier to use.
