Hurricane surge values were developed by the National Hurricane Center using the SLOSH (Sea Lake and Overland Surge from Hurricanes) Model. This Surge Inundation layer was created by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New England District. Using ArcInfo's Grid extension, LiDAR bare earth elevation data from both the State of Connecticut and FEMA was subtracted from the worst-case hurricane surge values to determine which areas could be expected to be inundated.
