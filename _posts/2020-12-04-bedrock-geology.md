Bedrock Geology Set is a 1:50,000-scale, polygon and line feature-based layer describing the solid material that underlies the soil or other unconsolidated material of the earth for Connecticut. Bedrock geologic formations are described as polygons in terms of formation name (incorporating geologic age), rock type, and tectonic terrane association. Tectonic forces are responsible for the present day geologic configuration of the continents. Resulting terranes are regionally fault bounded rocks of a similar tectonic history. Each terrane is named after its plate tectonics ancestry. Geologic lines include contacts, faults, and terrane boundaries. Terrane boundaries are named for the faults involved. The geologic contacts and faults are delineated and classified by type. Polygon feature attribute information is comprised of codes to identify individual bedrock geologic units, their formation name, description and size. Line feature attributes identify, name and describe bedrock contacts, faults and terrane boundaries between these bedrock geologic units. Data is compiled at 1:50,000 scale and is not updated. A complete description of the bedrock mapping units with mineralogical descriptions and a brief history of Connecticut geology are included in the Supplemental Information Section for reference.
