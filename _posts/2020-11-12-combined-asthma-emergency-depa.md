Note:  77% of overall reported events were geocoded by census tract level [ESRI ArcGIS], and the remaining 23% of events were equally weighted and redistributed proportionally within each town across the state. Therefore, all numbers and rates are estimates only, and reflect all asthma hospitalizations and ED visits that occurred in Connecticut from 2010-2014.
Rates based on counts fewer than 20 are unstable, and therefore are not presented; cells with less than 6 events are not displayed due to confidentiality regulations.
