Connecticut Town Index is a 1:125,000-scale polygon feature-based layer that includes a polygon feature for every Connecticut town (municipality). There are 169 town polygon features in this layer. The corresponding town number and town name attributes uniquely identify town polygon features. Town number values are based on the Town Codes issued by the State of Connecticut, Office of the State Controller, which range from 1 to 169. As a historic note, the Connecticut Town Index layer was originally digitized in 1986 by the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection using Esri ArcInfo 3 software installed on a mini computer. It was the first statewide GIS layer created by the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection. The data was in ArcInfo coverage format, Connecticut State Plane Coordinate System, North American Datum 1927, and map units feet.

Purpose: Connecticut Town Index is a general purpose index map of Connecticut towns that was compiled at 1:125,000 scale (1 inch equals approximately 2 miles). The layer is designed to be used to depict Connecticut towns at small scales or on small maps printed on regular size (8.5 x 11 inch) paper, for example. The Town Index layer does not accurately represent Connecticut town boundaries because it was digitized at 1:125,000 scale. Do not display, map or analyze the Town Index layer with information collected at larger scales. To depict more accurate 1:24,000-scale Connecticut town boundaries on a map, use the layer named Town, which is also published by the State of Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection.
