<div><a href='https://cteco.uconn.edu/guides/Critical_Habitat.htm' rel='nofollow ugc' target='_blank'>See full Data Guide here.</a><br /></div>Connecticut Critical Habitats is a polygon feature-based layer with a resolution of +/- 10 meters that represents significant natural community types occurring in Connecticut. This layer is a subset of habitat-related vegetation associations, described in Connecticut's Natural Vegetation Classification, that were designated as key habitats for species of Greatest Conservation Need in the Comprehensive Wildlife Conservation Strategy. These habitats are known to host a number of rare species including highly specialized invertebrates with very specific habitat associations. Some key habitats are broken into subtypes based on natural variations in plant species dominance and/or vegetation structure. These differences are apparent in the subtype names. Connecticut Critical Habitats can serve to highlight ecologically significant areas and to target areas of species diversity.

This layer can be used to perform various spatial analyses that pertain to Critical Habitats, to aid in determining site management and conservation priorities, prioritizing field surveys, and to further document the distribution and abundance of State-listed and/or rare vertebrate and invertebrate species within the significant habitats. Use this layer appropriately with data maintaining similar resolution. Not intended for maps printed at a resolution greater or more detailed than 1:2000.
