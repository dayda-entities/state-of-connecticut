The weekly and cumulative number of residents with confirmed COVID-19 and with COVID-19 associated deaths is obtained from data self-reported by individual assisted living facilities to the Long Term Care Mutual Aid Plan web-based reporting system (www.mutualaidplan.org/ct). Both confirmed and suspect deaths are included. 

Confirmed deaths include those among persons who tested positive for COVID-19. Suspected deaths include those among persons with signs and symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 but who did not have a laboratory positive COVID-19 test. Due to differing data collection and processing methods between LTC-MAP and the death data sources used previously, cumulative death data for residents was re-baselined on July 14, 2020. The resident death data before and after July 14, 2020 should not be added due to the differing definitions of COVID-19 associated deaths used and the possibility of duplication of deaths among prior and current data.  

The cumulative number of deaths among assisted living residents is based upon data reported by the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner. For public health surveillance, COVID-19-associated deaths include persons who tested positive for COVID-19 around the time of death (laboratory-confirmed) and persons whose death certificate lists COVID-19 disease as a cause of death or a significant condition contributing to death (probable). As of 7/15/20 deaths reported by the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner are no longer being updated on a weekly basis.
