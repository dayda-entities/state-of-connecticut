This dataset was created in accordance with The Alvin W. Penn Racial Profiling Prohibition Act (Connecticut General Statutes Sections 54-1l and 54-1m) which prohibits any law enforcement agency from stopping, detaining, or searching any motorist when the stop is motivated solely by considerations of the race, color, ethnicity, age, gender or sexual orientation.
