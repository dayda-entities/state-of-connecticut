The Long Island Sound Submerged Cable and Pipeline Areas layer is a polygon feature-based layer that includes the location of submerged cable and/or pipeline areas in Long Island Sound. These can include, but are not necessarily limited to: electric transmission lines, telephone and/or fiber optic cables, natural gas and/or petroleum pipelines, etc. The layer is based on information from the 2002 edition of digital National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) nautical charts provided by Maptech, Inc., a field survey completed by Ocean Surveys Inc (OSI) in 2002, and the *proposed* location of a pipeline from plans provided by Broadwater Energy in 2005. The Long Island Sound Submerged Cable and Pipeline Areas layer was originally created during the summer of 2002. The layer represents conditions at particular points in time. The layer includes representations of areas of underwater cables and/or pipelines. It does not include cable and/or pipeline areas landward of mean high water, nor does it include all possible submerged cables, pipelines, or other similar features. Features are polygon locations that represent the approximate or assumed location of cables and/or pipelines for the purpose of cartographic representation and general planning. Attribute information is comprised of codes to uniquely identify individual features, encode cable/pipeline type of information, and cartographically represent (symbolize) cable/pipeline features on a map. Data is compiled at 1:20,000 and 1:24,000 scale. This data is not planned for regular updates. Last updated 10/4/2005
