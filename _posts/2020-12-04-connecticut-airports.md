Airports Polygon is a 1:24,000-scale, feature-based layer that includes all airport features depicted on all of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle maps that cover the State of Connecticut and are listed on the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) "Airport Data (5010) & Contact Information" June 5, 2008 report.  Airports in New York, Massachusetts and Rhode Island that are near the Connecticut state boundary are included. Airports that are listed by FAA and are visible on aerial photography (Connecticut 2004 Orthophotos and Connecticut 2006 NAIP Color Orthophotos from National Agriculture Imagery Program) are included. Airports that are listed by FAA but are not visible on aerial photography are not included. All airports listed by FAA are included in a separate point feature-based layer, Airport FAA CT. The airport point locations were generated from latitude and longitude coordinates contained in the FAA report and all the attribute information in the report was included. The airport layer is based partly on information from USGS topographic quadrangle maps published between 1969 and 1984 which does not represent airports in Connecticut at any one particular point in time. The layer does depict current conditions as to airports listed by FAA and having location identification codes and visible on aerial photography of 2004 and 2006. The layer delineates airports and heliports. It includes airport name, airport location code, type of facility, public or private use of facility and state the airport is located in. It does not include airport elevation, flight schedule, runway capacity, or ownership information. Features are polygonal and generally depict landing strips and perimeters for large and small airports and helicopter landing pads. Attribute information allows to cartographic representation (symbolize) and labeling of these features on a map. This layer was originally published in 1994 and slightly updated in 2005.
