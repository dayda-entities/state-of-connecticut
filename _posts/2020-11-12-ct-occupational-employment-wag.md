The Connecticut Occupational Employment and Wage data provides employment and wage data by occupation and is based on the results of the Occupational Employment Statistics (OES) survey. The OES program conducts a bi-annual mail survey designed to produce estimates of employment and wages for over 800 occupations. These estimates are generated at the national, state, and metropolitan area levels. For more information, please visit us at http://www1.ctdol.state.ct.us/lmi/wages/default.asp.
