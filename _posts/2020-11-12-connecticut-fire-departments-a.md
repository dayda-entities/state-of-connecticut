This dataset contains Connecticut Fire Department as reported to the National Fire Incident Reporting System (NFIRS).

NFIRS collects details on Fire, HazMat and EMS incidences nationwide, detailing the kind of incident responded to, where it occurred, the resources used to mitigate it and more, with a goal of understanding the nature and causes of the incidents. Information is also collected on the number of civilian or firefighter casualties and an estimate of property loss.

Participation in NFIRS is voluntary.
