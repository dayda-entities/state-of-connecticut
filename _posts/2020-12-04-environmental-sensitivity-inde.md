Environmental Sensitivity Index 2002 Set:

This data set contains vector lines representing the shoreline and coastal habitats of Connecticut classified according to the Environmental Sensitivity Index (ESI) classification system. ESI data characterize the marine and coastal environments and wildlife by their sensitivity to spilled oil. The ESI data include information for three main components: shoreline habitats, sensitive biological resources, and human-use resources.The ESI data were collected, mapped, and digitized to provide environmental data for oil spill planning and response. The Clean Water Act with amendments by the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 requires response plans for immediate and effective protection of sensitive resources.
