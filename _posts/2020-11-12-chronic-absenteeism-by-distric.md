Chronic absenteeism is defined as missing 10 percent or more of the days enrolled in a school year for any reason. Commonly reported aggregate attendance measures such as average daily attendance in many instances do not adequately highlight the extent of student absenteeism. This dataset contains aggregate chronic absenteeism rates at the overall district level and by selected student subgroups. Percentages are presented where the cell statistic is representative of 20 students or more; where the cell statistic is representative of fewer than 20 total students the cell is suppressed and an asterisk is displayed. National research1 as well as Connecticut education data2 highlight the association of chronic absenteeism to student academic achievement and high school graduation. Chronic absenteeism is also a key metric in the Department of Education’s school turnaround initiatives (i.e., Alliance Districts and Commissioner’s Network schools).
