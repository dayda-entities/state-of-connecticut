Public Act 18-175 required executive branch agencies to designate an Agency Data Officer to serve as the primary contact for inquiries, requests, and concerns about access to data at their agency, and to be responsible for implementing the provisions of P.A. 18-175, including the development of an inventory of the agency's high value data and the creation of an open data access plan for the agency. 

This dataset includes a list of the name and contact information for the Agency Data Officers.
