Payments to businesses and other entities are at the core of State spending transparency. This data allows citizens to view who received payments from the State for goods or services and how much they received. Data from the CORE-CT Financial Accounting System are summarized by Agency, Payee, and Expense Account. Certain Payee Names have been removed in order to protect the privacy of individuals, in accordance with Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) regulations or where it might be a violation of protected information, in the case of Department of Criminal Justice Investigations. These redacted names appear as "REMOVED FOR PRIVACY." This data is static and is not live-updated.
