Providers of services reimbursed (partially or fully) by the federal government must periodically determine whether the amounts of the reimbursement for said services exceed a certain threshold, above which the provider must perform (or hire someone to perform), an audit of their records.  The purpose of this dataset is to give Providers of DCF contracted services the amounts for which the state of CT has claimed federal reimbursement for under TANF so that they can determine whether or not they will require an audit.  Each row in the dataset represents the amount that CT has claimed TANF reimbursement for a specific provider, program and reporting quarter
