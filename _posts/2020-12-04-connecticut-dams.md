Connecticut Dams is a 1:24,000 scale spatial data developed for use by the Dam Safety Section of the Inland Water Resources Division, Bureau of Water Protection and Land Reuse, Department of Environmental Protection, State of Connecticut. The Dam Safety Section of the Inland Water Resources Division is charged with the responsibility for administration and enforcement of Connecticut's dam safety laws. The existing statutes require that permits be obtained to construct, repair or alter dams, dikes or similar structures and that existing dams, dikes and similar structures be registered and periodically inspected to assure that their continued operation and use does not constitute a hazard to life, health or property. The dam safety statutes are codified in Section 22a-401 through 22a-411 inclusive of the Connecticut General Statutes. Sections 22a-409-1 and 22a-409-2 of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies, have been enacted which govern the registration, classification, and inspection of dams. The Connecticut Dams data depict the locations of dams throughout the state of Connecticut. The information may be dated in some instances and is best used in conjunction with other 1:24,000 scale data such as hydrography, drainage basins, and political boundaries. Attribute information includes a unique dam number and dam hazard classification that rates the potential hazard to life and property as defined by Connecticut State Statute (Section 22a-409-1d), in the event of a dam breach. This information is not intended to be used or printed at map scales greater or more detailed than 1:24,000 scale (1 in. = 2,000 ft.).
