This dataset contains the school performance indices (SPIs) for 2009-10 (2010), 2010-11 (2011), and 2011-12 (2012) for all schools that administered the Connecticut Academic Performance Test (CAPT). These data were published in the School Performance Reports released by the CT State Department of Education (CSDE) in December 2013 (see http://www.csde.state.ct.us/public/performancereports/20122013reports.asp)

Note: Cells are left blank if there is no SPI, which happens when there are small N sizes for a particular subgroup or subject.
