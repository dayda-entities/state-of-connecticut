This dataset contains aggregate data concerning the number of unique children placed in open DCF placements on the observation date (July 1st each year).  These figures are broken out by the DCF Region and Office responsible for the child's care, the child's Gender, whether the placement setting is in or out-of-state, and by the categorical Placement Type in which the child is residing on the observation date.
