Phragmites 1968 is a 1:12,000-scale, polygon feature-based layer that includes areas where phragmites existed in 1968 along the lower Connecticut River corridor from the towns of Portland and Cromwell south to Long Island Sound. This layer was published at the same time as the Phragmites 1994 layer in order to depict the historic differences in phragmites growth between 1968 and 1994. The Phragmites 1968 layer was compiled using 1:12,000 black and white digital orthophotos obtained in 1968 as part of a Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection aerial mapping survey. This data represents a particular point in time (1968). It is not updated and does not depcit current conditions. Features are polygon locations that represent the approximate location of phragmites growth in 1968. Attribute information is comprised of the NAME68 attribute that identifies one of 25 general locations of phragmites growth. Other attributes include AV_LEGEND that depicts the existence of phragmites, and ACREAGE that depicts the size of each polygon in acres. Data was compiled at a 1:12,000 scale.
