<div><a href='https://cteco.uconn.edu/guides/Parcel.htm' rel='nofollow ugc' target='_blank'>See full Data Guide here.Â </a><br /></div>Connecticut Parcels for Protected Open Space Mapping is a polygon feature-based layer that includes basic parcel-level information for some towns in Connecticut. This parcel layer includes information provided by individual municipalities.
These parcel data are incomplete and out of date. The accuracy, currency and completeness of the data reflect the content of the data at the time DEEP acquired the data from the individual municipalities. Attribute information is comprised of values such as town name and map lot block number. These data are not updated by CT DEEP and should only be used as a general reference. Critical decisions involving parcel-level information should be based on more recently acquired information from the respective municipalities. These parcels are not to be considered legal boundaries such as boundaries determined from certain classified survey maps or deed descriptions. Parcel boundaries shown in this layer are based on information from municipalities used for property tax purposes.
Largely due to differences in horizontal accuracy among various data layers, do not expect these parcel boundaries to line up exactly with or be properly postioned relative to features shown on other layers available from CT DEEP such as scanned USGS topography quadrangle maps, roads, hydrography, town boundaries, and even orthophotograpy.

The data in the parcel layer was obtained from individual Connecticut municipalities. An effort was made to collect data once from each municipality. The data acquisition date for each set of municipally-supplied parcel data was not recorded and CT DEEP does not keep this information up-to-date. Consequently, these data are out-of-date, incomplete and do not reflect the current state of property ownership in these municipalities. These parcels are not to be considered legal boundaries such as boundaries determined from certain classified survey maps or deed descriptions. Parcel boundaries shown in this layer are based on information from municipalities used for property tax purposes. Parcel boundaries and attribute information have not been updated in this layer since the time the information was originally acquired by CT DEEP. For example, property boundaries are incorrect where subdivisions have occurred. Also, field attribute values are populated only if the information was supplied to CT DEEP. For example, parcels in some towns lack location (street name) information or possibly map lot block values. Therefore, field attributes are inconsistent, may include gaps, and do not represent complete sets of values among all towns. They should not be compared and analyzed across towns. It is emphasized that critical decisions involving parcel-level information be based on more recently obtained information from the respective municipalities. These data are only suitable for general reference purposes. Be cautious when using these data. Many Connecticut municipalities provide access to more up-to-date and more detailed property ownership information on the Internet. This dataset includes parcel information for the following towns: Andover, Ansonia, Ashford, Avon, Beacon Falls, Berlin, Bethany, Bethel, Bethlehem, Bloomfield, Bolton, Branford, Bridgewater, Brookfield, Brooklyn, Canaan, Canterbury, Canton, Chaplin, Cheshire, Chester, Clinton, Colchester, Colebrook, Columbia, Cornwall, Coventry, Cromwell, Danbury, Darien, Deep River, Derby, East Granby, East Haddam, East Hampton, East Hartford, East Lyme, East Windsor, Eastford, Ellington, Enfield, Essex, Farmington, Franklin, Glastonbury, Granby, Greenwich, Griswold, Groton, Guilford, Haddam, Hamden, Hartford, Hebron, Kent, Killingly, Killingworth, Lebanon, Ledyard, Lisbon, Litchfield, Lyme, Madison, Manchester, Mansfield, Marlborough, Meriden, Middlebury, Middlefield, Middletown, Milford, Monroe, Montville, Morri
