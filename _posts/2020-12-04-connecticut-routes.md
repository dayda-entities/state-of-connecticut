It is derived from the Connecticut Route Segments layer, which is based on spatial information from the U.S. Bureau of Census that was published for Connecticut by the University of Connecticut, Center for Geographic Information and Analysis. The spatial information (line feature geometry) from the U.S. Bueau of Census was compiled for the year 2000 and used to create a continuous line feature for each interstate highway and route shown on the State Tourism Map 2002-2003 published by the Connecticut Department of Transportation. The Connecticut Routes layer does not include local roads, highway entrance and exit ramps, highway rest areas, exit numbers, house address, traffic direction, or traffic volume information. Features are linear and represent divided and undivided route centerlines mapped at 1:100,000 scale (1 inch = 1.578 mile).
