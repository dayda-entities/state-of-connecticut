The Long Island Sound Study developed these digital data from 1:100,000-scale National Oceanic &amp; Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and United States Geological Survey (USGS) maps as a general reference to the depth of water in Long Island Sound. In 1996, these data were digitized from paper maps by the Long Island Sound Study (<a href='http://www.longislandsoundstudy.net' rel='nofollow ugc' target='_blank'>http://www.longislandsoundstudy.net</a>) and incorporated into a Long Island Sound GIS database. Not intended for maps printed at map scales greater or more detailed than 1:100,000 scale (1 inch = 1,578 feet.)
Dataset credit: Applied Geographics, Inc. of Boston, Massachussets was contracted by the Long Island Sound Study to automate and digitize these bathymetry data for Long Island Sound. Linda Bischoff, GIS Analyst, digitized the data and created the orginal metadata.
