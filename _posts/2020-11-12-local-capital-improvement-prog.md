The Local Capital Improvement Program (LoCIP) distributes funds to municipalities to reimburse the cost of eligible local capital improvement projects such as road, bridge or public building construction activities. A municipality can request LoCIP funds by completing a simple application form for project approval and project reimbursement that gives a general description of the project, its work location, and the actual cost of the project. Each year, the State Office of Policy and Management provides a formula based entitlement to each municipality's available LoCIP balance. These funds can accumulate from year to year
