This dataset contains aggregate data concerning the number of children with substantiated abuse/neglect reports, and for whom the end of a 6 month observation period (starting with either the date the substantiated report had been accepted, or the specific incident date if one was provided) terminated during the SFY.  These figures are broken out by the DCF Region and Office responsible for the child's care, by their Gender, and by whether another report of substantiated abuse/neglect occurred within 12 months of the first substantiation or not.  It would be appropriate to roll up the data from all variables across multiple time periods, as they represent specific events in the lives of these children.  These data form the basis of measurement for the Juan F. Consent Decree Exit Plan Outcome #7: Safety Maintained (No Repeat Maltreatment), although those figures are reported to the DCF Court Monitor on a quarterly rather than annual schedule.
