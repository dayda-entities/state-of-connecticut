These statistics are the first results from Connecticut's Next Generation Accountability Model for districts and schools. For detailed information and resources about every indicator including the rationale for its inclusion, the methodology used as well as links to resources, research, and evidence-based strategies, please see the document titled Using Accountability Results to Guide Improvement at http://www.sde.ct.gov/sde/lib/sde/pdf/evalresearch/using_accountability_results_to_guide_improvement_20160228.pdf

This model is the direct result of an extensive consultation process over a two-year period. The CSDE sought feedback from district and school leaders, Connecticut educators, state and national experts, CSDE staff, and many others. This model was outlined in Connecticut's flexibility application to the U.S. Department of Education and formally approved by the USED in August 2015.
