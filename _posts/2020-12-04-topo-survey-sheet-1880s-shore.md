Connecticut Historic Shoreline Wetlands:

1880s NOS T-Sheet Shoreline Features is a 1:10,000-scale, line feature-based layer that includes information depicting historic shoreline features and wetland boundaries for areas of coastal Connecticut during the 1880s. The layer depicts information found on topographic survey sheets (T-sheets) from the US Coast and Geodetic Survey (USC&GS), a predecessor to the National Ocean Service (NOS). The layer represents conditions at a particular point in time. The layer does not depict current conditions. The layer includes ground condition features such as approximate shoreline, shoreline, wetland shoreline, wetland upland boundaries, wetland interior boundaries, man-made shoreline, jetties/breakwaters/groins, and piers/ramps/docks. Semi-submerged marshes, referred to here as "low marshes," ocurring where it is possible to discern marsh-like features waterward of the shoreline are also included. Off shore and riverine islands and rocks may be included depending on the quality of their depiction on the t-sheet. It does not include any non shoreline-centric elements that may have been depicted on the t-sheets such as buildings, roads, bridges, etc., nor does it include other off-shore features like sandbars, mud flats, tidal flats, etc. Features are line locations that represent the approximate location of shoreline features and wetland boundaries. Shoreline, as depicted on the T-sheets that pre-date 1927, reference an approximation of Mean High Water (MHW). Although MHW is technically determined by averaging the height of the high water line, (HWL) the landward extent of the last high tide over a 19 year lunar cycle, USC&GS topographers appoximated MHW by familarizing themselves with the tidal conditions in a given area and noting the assorted physical characteristics of the beach. (For a more complete description of this and other shoreline indicators, the reader is directed to the following article: "Historical Shoreline Change: Error Analysis and Mapping Accuracy," Crowell, M., Leatherman, S., and Buckley, M. Journal of Coastal Research, Vol 7, No. 3, 1991, pp 839-852.)
Attribute information is comprised of codes to identify individual features, encode shoreline feature type information, and cartographically represent (symbolize) shoreline features on a map. These codes were derived in part from the National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Coastal Services Center (CSC) Historic Digital Shoreline Capture project and modified by the State of Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection to address the inclusion of wetland areas. This data was compiled at 1:10,000 scale. This data is not updated.
Purpose: 1880s NOS T-Sheet Shoreline Features is 1:10,000-scale data. It depicts the location of historic shoreline features and wetland boundaries for all of coastal Connecticut with the exception of the area of New Haven Harbor from the West River in West Haven to the New Haven/East Haven town boundary. The features also extend slightly beyond the Connecticut state lines into Rye, New York and Westerly, Rhode Island. Use this layer to display historic shoreline and wetlands. Since this data may be considered a crucial element in land use planning, determination of boundary extents, performing change studies for erosion and accretion examinations and other types of decision making this layer may also be used for analytic purposes. Use this layer with other 1:10,000-scale map data such as any other NOS T-sheet Shoreline or Wetland layers. Not intended for maps printed at map scales greater or more detailed than 1:10,000 scale (1 inch = 833.33 feet.)

1880s NOS T-Sheet Wetland Polygon Features is a 1:10,000-scale, polygon feature-based layer that includes information depicting historic wetlands for areas of coastal Connecticut during the 1880s. The layer depicts information found on topographic survey sheets (T-sheets) from the US Coast and Geodetic Survey (USC&GS), a predecessor to
