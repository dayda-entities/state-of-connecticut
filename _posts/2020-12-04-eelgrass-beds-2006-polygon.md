Eelgrass Beds 2006 Set:

This data layer was created by the USFWS National Wetlands Inventory, Region 5. Delineations of 2006 eelgrass beds were completed on the eastern Connecticut shoreline to the Rhode Island border. Fisher Island, Plum Island, and the northern shore of Long Island, New York were also included in this work. Spring 2006 True Color aerial photography was taken at a scale of 1:20,000 and used for detemining location and delineation of eelgrass beds. Extensive field work was conducted by the USFWS Region 5 Southern Coastal Zone program in September, October and November, with 290 field sites. The 2006 photography was scanned and geo-rectified using 2004 ADS 1/2 meter true color imagery.

This dataset contains point data for eelgrass verification field work completed in 2006 by the US Fish & Wildlife Service. Field work was conducted during September, October and November of 2006. The resulting information was used extensivley in the creation of the accompanyng polygonal eelgrass dataset.
