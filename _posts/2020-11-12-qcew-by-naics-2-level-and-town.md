Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW) by NAICS (2 level) and Towns.

Source:  Connecticut Department of Labor Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW).  QCEW data is regularly reviewed to correct and/or update industry (NAICS) codes that no longer reflect the ongoing business activity of a firm. Because of these corrections, in some cases changes from year to year may over or understate the actual changes occurring within the industry sector.   Any questions regarding this data may directed to dol.lmi@ct.gov
