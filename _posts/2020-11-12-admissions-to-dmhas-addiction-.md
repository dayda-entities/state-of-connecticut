This dataset includes monthly admission counts- by primary drug of choice- to DMHAS funded/operated treatment, organized by clients' town of residence. 

Towns with 5 or fewer admissions in any given month have been suppressed.  Values of less than 6 have been replaced with an asterisk (*).  

These data should be considered supplemental to the report "DMHAS Addiction Treatment by Town, Year, and Month".
