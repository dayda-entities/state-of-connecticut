Connecticut Sewer Service Area is 1:24,000-scale, polygon feature-based data that depict sanitary waste water sewer service areas in Connecticut. Most if not all homes and businesses located within a sewer service area discharge sanitary waste water into the local sewer system. Service areas are delineated along streets and around structures and built-up areas shown on the USGS topographic quadrangle maps and orthophotos where sewer pipes were present on the more detailed sewer system maps. The sewer service area boundaries are approximate and may not encompass all areas and establishments currently discharging into the local sewer system. Depicts the areal extent of wastewater sewer systems in existence at the time DEP last updated this information. Data is compiled at a map scale of 1:24,000 (1 inch =2,000 ft). Attribute information includes a code that distinguishes between existing and proposed areas of sewer service.
Information was last updated in 1998, with a minor update to New London and Waterford sewer service areas in May, 2006.
