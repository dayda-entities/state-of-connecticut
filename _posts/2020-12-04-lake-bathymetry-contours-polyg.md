<div><a href='https://www.cteco.uconn.edu/guides/lake_bathymetry.htm' rel='nofollow ugc' target='_blank'>See full Data Guide here.</a>Â </div>Lake Bathymetry describes the water depth for selected reservoirs, lakes, ponds, and coves in Connecticut. It includes depth contours, also called bathymetric contours, that define lines of equal water depth in feet. This information was collected and compiled by the State of Connecticut, Department of Environmental Protection over a period of time using a variety of different techniques and equipment including manual depth soundings, use of an electronic depth sounder in conjunction with a GPS receiver to locate the boat, and digitizing previously published bathymetry maps. Data is compiled at a variety of scales and resolutions, depending on the collection method used for a particular waterbody. A list of the waterbodies included in this layer can be viewed in the GIS Metadata for Lake Bathymetry. This information was used to publish bathymetric maps in A Fisheries Guide to Lakes and Ponds of Connecticut, Robert P. Jacobs, Eileen B. O'Donnell, and William B. Gerrish, Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection Bulletin 35, 2002, SBN 0-942085-11-6.
