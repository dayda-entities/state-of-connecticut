This dataset contains liens filed with the Business Services Division of the Office of the Secretary of the State. Most liens are filed under the Uniform Commercial Code, but the dataset also contains vessel and aircraft liens, and liens filed by the Internal Revenue Service, the Connecticut Department of Labor, and municipalities.

The dataset only contains liens that are active (e.g., not lapsed) or that are less than one year past their natural lapse date. Note that liens showing a lapse date of December 31, 9999 have no lapse date and are effective until released/terminated.
