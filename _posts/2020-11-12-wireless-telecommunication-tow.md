The information presented in this data set is based on records of dockets, petitions, tower share requests, and notices of exempt modifications received and processed by the Council. 

This database is not an exhaustive listing of all wireless telecommunications sites in the state in that it does not include all information about sites not under the jurisdiction of the Siting Council. 

Although the Connecticut Siting Council makes every effort to keep this spreadsheet current and accurate, the Council makes no representation or warranty as to the accuracy of the data presented herein.

The public is advised that the records upon which the information in this database is based are kept in the Siting Councilâ€™s offices at Ten Franklin Square, New Britain and are open for public inspection during normal working hours from 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Monday through Friday.

Note to Users: Over the years, some of the wireless companies have had several different corporate identities. In the database, they are identified by the name they had at the time of their application to the Siting Council. To help database users follow the name changes, the list below shows the different names by which the companies have been known. Recent mergers in the telecommunications industry have joined companies listed as separate entities. AT&T Wireless merged with Cingular to do business as New Cingular. Sprint and Nextel have merged to form Sprint/Nextel Corporation. 

Cingular: SNET, SCLP, and New Cingular after merger with AT&T

T-Mobile: Omni (Omnipoint), VoiceStream
