Sterile Products

Compounded sterile products can be produced as a patient specific medication or a non-patient specific medication.  

Non-Patient Specific

The following list is composed of facilities both within and outside of the state of Connecticut that have appropriately registered with the state of Connecticut and the Food and Drug Administration. The state of Connecticut does not endorse any of these companies and does not maintain a list of the products that they are permitted to compound and distribute. The companies on this list are permitted to send medication that is not patient specific to a pharmacy or practitioner for dispensing or administration. Please contact the individual business to determine what products they can provide.
