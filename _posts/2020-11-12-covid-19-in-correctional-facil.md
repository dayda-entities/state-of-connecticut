Additional notes:
The data on 7/15 reflects a decrease in the number of inmates testing positive for COVID-19 and those who have recovered; this decrease was due to an internal data audit that led to the removal of some duplicate information. 

The data on 6/2/2020 reflects an increase in the number of inmates who had been medically cleared; this increase was the result of 146 asymptomatic positive inmates who had completed a 14-day isolation period.
