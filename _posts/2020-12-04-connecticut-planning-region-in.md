Connecticut Planning Region Index is a general purpose index map of Connecticut Planning Regions based on mapped information compiled at 1:125,000 scale (1 inch equals approximately 2 miles) and a list of towns in each region available from the State of Connecticut, Office of Policy and Management. The layer is designed to be used to depict Connecticut Planning Regions at small scales or on small maps printed on regular size (8.5 x 11 inch) paper, for example. This Planning Region Index layer does not accurately represent planning region boundaries because it was digitized at 1:125,000 scale. Do not display, map or analyze this index layer with information collected at larger scales. To depict more accurate 1:24,000-scale Connecticut state, county, town, and planning region boundaries on a map, use the layer named Town, which is also published by the State of Connecticut Department of Energy &amp; Environmental Protection. The 2012 Edition reflects consolidation of two organizations into the Lower Connecticut River Council of Governments.
