COVID-19 test results by date of specimen collection, including total, positive, negative, and indeterminate for molecular and antigen tests. Molecular tests reported include polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and nucleic acid amplicfication (NAAT) tests.

Test results may be reported several days after the result. Data are incomplete for the most recent days. Data from previous dates are routinely updated. Records with a null date field summarize tests reported that were missing the date of collection.

Starting in July 2020, this dataset will be updated every weekday.
