This dataset contains aggregate data concerning the number of children who entered and/or exited DCF placement during a given calendar month.  These figures are broken out by the child's Age Group (based on age at date of entry/exit), and the Race/Ethnicity category with which the child identifies.  The dataset is updated every two weeks, with a two week delay built into the update to allow for data entry to be complete and correct.
