Listing of licensed automobile dealers and repairers, updated nightly.
Many Dealer and Repairer licenses are issued in a business name but the facility may be doing business in another name (have a DBA = Doing-Business-As).  For example, XYZ Corporation may be doing business as Joe’s Garage. The address of Joe’s Garage will be on the list but the license will be in the XYZ Corporation name.
