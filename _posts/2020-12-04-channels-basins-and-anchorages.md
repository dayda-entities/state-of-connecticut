Channels, Basins, and Anchorages is a 1:20,000-scale, polygon feature-based layer that includes the location of channels, turning basins, and anchorages within (mostly) Connecticut waters. The layer is derived from information depicted on the 2002 edition of digital National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) nautical charts, Maptech, Inc. and US Army Corps of Engineers (USACOE) Volume 3 - Rivers & Harbors of Rhode Island and Connecticut Project Maps publication dated Sept 1988. The Channels, Basins, and Anchorages layer was compiled during the summer of 2001. The layer represents conditions at a particular point in time. The layer includes representations of areas of channels, turning basins, and anchorages that are or may be periodically maintained by various entitites for commercial and recreational uses. It does not include all possible/potential such areas, just those identified on the source documents; nor does the layer include any buoys or channel markers designating the bounds or entrances to channels, basins, or anchorages. Features are polygon locations that represent the approximate or assumed location of channels, turning basins, and anchorages. Attribute information is comprised of codes to uniquely identify individual features, encode feature information, and cartographically represent (symbolize) channels, turning basins, and anchorages features on a map. Data is compiled at 1:20,000 scale. This data is not updated.

Channels, Basins, and Anchorages is 1:20,000-scale data. It depicts the location of federal and non-federal channels, basins, and anchorages areas. Use this layer to display the locations of underwater boating/shipping areas in and around Long Island Sound and the waterways of Connecticut. Use this layer with 1:20,000-scale map data such as the 2002 digital National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Nautical Charts or with any other 1:24,000 scale DEP natural resource data. Not intended for maps printed at map scales greater or more detailed than 1:20,000 scale (1 inch = 1,666.66 feet.)
