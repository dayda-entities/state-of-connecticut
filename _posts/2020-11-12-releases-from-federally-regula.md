This list provides information about releases from federally regulated Underground Storage Tank (UST) Systems that have been, and are scheduled to be, reported to the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) by the CT DEEP. There are approximately 3600 releases from federally regulated USTs on this list. Federally regulated USTs include USTs containing heating fuel for resale purposes and USTs that contain gasoline, diesel, kerosene, and waste oil. To learn more about federally regulated USTs please see the EPA's UST website (https://www.epa.gov/ust/learn-about-underground-storage-tanks-usts). 

This dataset is a subset of records and information that may be available about releases from federally regulated USTs that have occurred at specific locations. This dataset does not replace a full review of files publicly available either using the DEEP on-line Public Portal (https://filings.deep.ct.gov/DEEPDocumentSearchPortal/) and/or at the DEEP Record Center File Room (https://portal.ct.gov/DEEP/About/Environmental-Quality-Records-Records-Center-File-Room). 

‒	This list does not contain releases from non-federally regulated USTs (i.e. releases from residential heating fuel USTs).
‒	Not every type of release from a federally regulated UST System is required to be reported to the EPA. 
‒	Not every release from a federally UST System is reported to the DEEP. We can only report the information we receive.
‒	We know there may be errors in the data although we strive to minimize them. Examples of errors may include: misspelled or incomplete addresses and/or missing data.

If errors are found please contact the program unit using the following email address:  DEEP.Leakingust@ct.gov .
