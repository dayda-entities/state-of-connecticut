Retail Sales by Town for all NAICS Retail Sectors
* Please note that retailers with more than one establishment usually report all of their sales and use taxes from their primary location; therefore the amounts for various towns may not reflect actual business activity

** Total Tax Due includes some tax amounts at the 6% rate from returns filed on cash basis. Sales and Use tax data at the 9.35% rate applicable to short-term rentals or leasing of motor vehicles are not included to comply with disclosure requirements.
