As of 10/22/2020, this dataset is no longer being updated and has been replaced with a new dataset, which can be accessed here: https://data.ct.gov/Health-and-Human-Services/COVID-19-case-rate-per-100-000-population-and-perc/hree-nys2

This dataset includes the average daily COVID-19 case rate per 100,000 population by town over the last two MMWR weeks (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/MMWR_week_overview.pdf).

These counts do not include cases among people residing in congregate settings, such as nursing homes, assisted living facilities, or correctional facilities.

This dataset will be updated weekly.
