Connecticut County Index is a general purpose index map of Connecticut counties based on information compiled at 1:125,000 scale (1 inch equals approximately 2 miles). The layer is designed to be used to depict Connecticut counties at small scales or on small maps printed on regular size (8.5 x 11 inch) paper, for example. This County Index layer does not accurately represent Connecticut county boundaries because it was digitized at 1:125,000 scale. Do not display, map or analyze the County Index layer with information collected at larger scales. To depict more accurate 1:24,000-scale Connecticut state, county, and town boundaries on a map, use the layer named Town, which is also published by the State of Connecticut Department of Energy &amp;Â Environmental Protection.
