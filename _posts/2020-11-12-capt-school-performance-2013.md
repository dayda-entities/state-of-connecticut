This dataset contains the school classifications, school performance indices (SPIs), and SPI target attainment status for 2012-13 for all schools that administered the Connecticut Academic Performance Test (CAPT). It also includes school classifications assigned to high schools with non-tested grades. These data were published in the School Performance Reports released by the CT State Department of Education (CSDE) in December 2013 (see http://www.csde.state.ct.us/public/performancereports/20122013reports.asp)

Note: Target attainment status will say “n/a” if there is no 2012-13 SPI target or if there is no 2012-13 SPI, which happens when there are small N sizes for a particular subgroup or subject.
