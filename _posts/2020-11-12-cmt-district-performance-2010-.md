This dataset contains the Connecticut Mastery Test (CMT) district performance indices (DPIs) for 2009-10 (2010), 2010-11 (2011), and 2011-12 (2012). These data were published in the District Performance Reports released by the CT State Department of Education (CSDE) in December 2013 (see http://www.csde.state.ct.us/public/performancereports/20122013reports.asp)
 
Note: Cells are left blank if there is no DPI, which happens when there are small N sizes for a particular subgroup or subject.
