Connecticut Major Drainage Basins is 1:24,000-scale, polygon and line feature data that define Major drainage basin areas in Connecticut. These large basins mostly range from 70 to 2,000 square miles in size. Connecticut Major Drainage Basins includes drainage areas for all Connecticut rivers, streams, brooks, lakes, reservoirs and ponds published on 1:24,000-scale 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle maps prepared by the USGS between 1969 and 1984. Data is compiled at 1:24,000 scale (1 inch = 2,000 feet). This information is not updated.
Polygon and line features represent drainage basin areas and boundaries, respectively. Each basin area (polygon) feature is outlined by one or more major basin boundary (line) feature. These data include 10 major basin area (polygon) features and 284 major basin boundary (line) features.
Major Basin area (polygon) attributes include major basin number and feature size in acres and square miles. The major basin number (MBAS_NO) uniquely identifies individual basins and is 1 character in length. There are 8 unique major basin numbers. Examples include 1, 4, and 6. Note there are more major basin polygon features (10) than unique major basin numbers (8) because two polygon features are necessary to represent both the entire South East Coast and Hudson Major basins in Connecticut.
Major basin boundary (line) attributes include a drainage divide type attribute (DIVIDE) used to cartographically represent the hierarchical drainage basin system. This divide type attribute is used to assign different line symbology to different levels of drainage divides. For example, major basin drainage divides are more pronounced and shown with a wider line symbol than regional basin drainage divides.
Connecticut Major Drainage Basin polygon and line feature data are derived from the geometry and attributes of the Connecticut Drainage Basins data.
