This dataset includes the learning models (in-person, hybrid, and remote) by grade level and the percentage of students who are fully remote by public school district during a given week of the school year. 

When an asterisk is displayed, data have been suppressed to safeguard student confidentiality, or to ensure that statistics based on a very small sample size are not interpreted as equally representative as those based on a sufficiently larger sample size. For more information on CSDE data suppression policies, please visit http://edsight.ct.gov/relatedreports/BDCRE%20Data%20Suppression%20Rules.pdf.
