As of March 13, 2015, all proposed state regulations must be written in the new eRegulations System. The primary purpose of the system is to improve public accessibility and transparency in the regulations process. A secondary goal, however, is to streamline the process by automating certain steps. This tracker will demonstrate the speed at which regulations historically went through the process vs. how quickly proposed regulations are moving through the process through the eRegulations System.  Regulations are now available at eregulations.ct.gov.
